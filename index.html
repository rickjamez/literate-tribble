    <h3> 20% accurate as usual, Morty. </h3>
    <h4> Still here, still selling fake doors. </h4>
    <h5> Yo Scary T, don't even triiip about your pants, duh-awg. Here's a pair on us fool!
You're our boy dog, don't even trip. </h5>
    <h6> My pancakes are about to reach that point of syrup absorption that turns them into a mushy paste. </h6>
    <p> Get off the high road Summer. We all got pink eye because you wouldn't stop texting on the toilet. They're robots Morty! It's okay to shoot them! They're just robots! Why are you doing this bit? We're gonna die. Like nothing shady ever happened in a fully furnished office? You ever hear about Wall Street Morty? You know what those guys do in their fancy board rooms? They take their balls and dip 'em in cocaine and wipe 'em all over each other. You know Grandpa goes around and he does his business in public because grandpa isn't shady.
